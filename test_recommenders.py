"""TODO

Write a program that checks that recommenders works as expected

We will use pytest
to install pytest run in the terminal 
+ pip install pytest
/ conda install pytest

TDD (Test-driven-development)  cycle:

0. Make an Hypothesis:
    the units/programs work
1. Write test that fails (to disprove the Hypothesis)
2. Change the code so that the Hypothesis is re-established
3. repeat 0-->2
